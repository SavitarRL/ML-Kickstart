# ML-Kickstart

1. Regression 
- self-written neural network for linear and quadratic regression and comparison using Pytorch (in `polynomials/learning functions.ipynb`)
- Quantum ML:  linear regression using Qiskit and SciPy (in `polynomials/qml_linear.ipynb`)

2. Classification 
- Image classification on MNIST dataset using neural networks (in `mnist/main_mnist.ipynb`)
- Iris classification using Support Vector Classifier and Variational Quantum Classifier (in `PCA/VQC.ipynb`)

3. Text classification (in `text classification`; to be done)
